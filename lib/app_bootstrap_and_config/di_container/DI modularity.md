## Introduction

As a Flutter project grows, managing dependencies using only a global [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) instance quickly becomes unmaintainable. **Modular DI** structures the registration of services, repositories, data sources, use cases, and state management, making your app maintainable, scalable, and testable.

This document compares two modern approaches to modular DI in Flutter, each used by high-performing teams, and explains where each shines.

---

## Why Modular DI?

- **Explicit boundaries** between app features and core infrastructure
- **Clear dependency relationships** for onboarding and refactoring
- **Feature toggling:** Easily enable/disable app features for A/B tests or flavors
- **Testability:** Swap out entire modules for testing, mocking, or hot reload
- **Scalability:** Teams can develop and own separate features/modules in parallel

---

## Approach 1: Modular Classes with Dependency Manager

### How It Works

- Each module is a **class implementing a shared interface** (e.g., `DIModule`), declaring its name, dependencies, and registration logic.
- A central **ModuleManager** handles dependency resolution, ensuring modules are registered in the correct order.
- Module dependencies are **explicitly declared** and resolved at runtime.
- Modules can implement a `dispose()` method for cleanup (useful for testing, hot-reload, or dynamic module swapping).

#### Example Structure

```dart
abstract interface class DIModule {
  String get name;
  List<Type> get dependencies => const [];
  Future<void> register();
  Future<void> dispose() async {}
}

final class AuthModule implements DIModule {
  @override
  String get name => 'AuthModule';
  @override
  List<Type> get dependencies => [CoreModule];

  @override
  Future<void> register() async {
    // Register dependencies via GetIt here...
  }
}

final class ModuleManager {
  static Future<void> registerModules(List<DIModule> modules) async { ... }
}
```

#### Registration

```dart
await ModuleManager.registerModules([
  CoreModule(),
  AuthModule(),
  ProfileModule(),
]);
```

---

### Pros & Cons

#### Pros

- **Explicit, self-documenting dependencies:** Each module declares what it requires. Onboarding is faster and code reviews are clearer.
- **Automatic dependency resolution:** The manager guarantees correct registration order (and can detect circular dependencies).
- **Centralized lifecycle management:** All modules can be disposed or re-registered as needed.
- **Excellent for large, multi-team codebases:** Each team can own their feature module with clear contracts.
- **Supports advanced tooling:** Easy to add diagnostics, performance logging, or even runtime feature toggling.
- **Easy testing/mocking:** Swap entire modules for integration or widget testing.

#### Cons

- **More boilerplate:** Every module is a class, and you must implement the interface.
- **Slightly higher entry barrier:** New team members must understand module/dependency patterns.
- **Runtime checks:** Misconfigured dependencies will fail at startup, not compile-time.

---

### Recommended Use Cases

- **Large/Enterprise Flutter apps**
- **Projects with many features, or “SuperApp” architectures**
- **Multiple teams working on different features**
- **Apps requiring dynamic module loading, feature toggling, or automated testing/mocking**
- **CI/CD pipelines needing isolated integration tests**

---

### Abstract Example

> **Scenario:** Your app has `Core`, `Auth`, `Profile`, and `Chat` modules.

```dart
await ModuleManager.registerModules([
  CoreModule(),
  AuthModule(),
  ProfileModule(),
  ChatModule(),
]);
```

- Each module declares dependencies, e.g., `ChatModule` may depend on `AuthModule` and `CoreModule`.
- Manager sorts and registers modules, logging or failing if any dependency is missing or circular.

---

## Approach 2: Static Registration Functions

### How It Works

- Each module/feature provides **one or more static functions** for dependency registration.
- Registration is performed manually in a specific order by calling each module’s `register()` method.
- No centralized manager—**the registration order and dependency fulfillment are the developer’s responsibility**.
- “Minimal” and “full” registrations can be handled via different static functions (e.g., for splash screen, only core deps).

#### Example Structure

```dart
abstract final class AuthDIModule {
  static Future<void> register() async {
    // Register Auth feature dependencies via GetIt here...
  }
}

abstract final class DIContainer {
  static Future<void> initFull() async {
    await CoreDIModule.register();
    await AuthDIModule.register();
    await ProfileDIModule.register();
    // etc.
  }
}
```

#### Registration

```dart
await DIContainer.initFull(); // manually ensure the right order!
```

---

### Pros & Cons

#### Pros

- **Minimal code/boilerplate:** No need for module classes or dependency declarations.
- **Easy to start:** Ideal for MVPs, small projects, or solo developers.
- **Direct, readable order:** Registration is explicit in the order you call methods.

#### Cons

- **No explicit dependency contracts:** It’s easy to break things by reordering or forgetting a registration.
- **No automatic detection of missing/circular dependencies:** Bugs may be harder to trace.
- **No centralized lifecycle or cleanup:** Harder to manage in tests, reloads, or shutdowns.
- **Not scalable:** As the app grows, it becomes harder to maintain and test reliably.

---

### Recommended Use Cases

- **Small projects, prototypes, MVPs**
- **Solo or small teams**
- **Codebases with few features and little chance of rapid scaling**
- **When onboarding overhead must be minimized**

---

### Abstract Example

> **Scenario:** Your app has `Core`, `Auth`, and `Profile` modules.

```dart
await CoreDIModule.register();
await AuthDIModule.register();
await ProfileDIModule.register();
```

- Order is crucial: `Auth` might fail if `Core` is not registered first.

## Summary and Recommendations

**For most scalable, maintainable, and testable Flutter projects—especially those with multiple features or teams—**

> **_Approach 1: Modular Classes with Dependency Manager_** is preferred by experienced engineers and enterprise teams.

- Use this approach for all production projects expecting significant growth, modularization, CI/CD, or complex testing.

**For simple apps, prototypes, and hackathons, or when onboarding speed is more important than long-term maintainability—**

> **_Approach 2: Static Registration Functions_** is acceptable.

- Be aware that you'll likely need to refactor to a more modular system as your app and team scale.
