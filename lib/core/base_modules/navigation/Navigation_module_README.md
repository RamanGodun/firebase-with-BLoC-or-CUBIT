# 🧭 Navigation Module Guide

*Last updated: 2025-08-01*

----------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 GOAL

This module provides a **universal, declarative, and scalable navigation system** for Flutter apps, 
based on GoRouter. It encapsulates all route declarations, observers, redirect logic, 
and navigation extensions, and supports navigation side-effects, auth-driven routing 
and **both Riverpod and Cubit/BLoC** via fully decoupled DI (navigation is state-agnostic). 

🦾 Designed for Clean Architecture, scalable projects, and modular codebases


----------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Quick Start

All navigation logic, transitions, redirects, and overlay handling are configured out-of-the-box.
Just injects GoRouter into `MaterialApp.router` and define your routes and redirects/extend as needed.

### With Riverpod:

```dart
// main.dart (after DI and localization initialization)
runApp(
  ProviderScope(
    parent: GlobalDIContainer.instance,
    child: AppLocalizationShell(),
  ),
);

// In your root shell widget:
final router = ref.watch(routerProvider);

MaterialApp.router(
  routerConfig: router,
  // ...theme, localization, overlays, etc
);
```

### With Cubit/BLoC:

```dart
// main.dart (after DI and localization initialization)
runApp(GlobalProviders(child: AppLocalizationShell()));

// In your root shell widget:
final router = buildGoRouter(context.select((AuthCubit c) => c.state));

MaterialApp.router(
  routerConfig: router,
  // ...theme, localization, overlays, etc
);
```

* UI rebuilds **only when necessary** thanks to Riverpod’s `.select()` / `BLoCSelector`

## 📦 File Structure

*> Each file/folder is responsible for a clear separation of navigation concerns: 
routes config, transitions, observers, redirects, extension methods.

## 🧩 Architecture & Flow

> **Everything in this module is declarative, predictable, and extensible — ready for real-world apps.**

* **Declarative routes:**
  All routes, names, and paths are defined centrally and strictly typed. `app_routes.dart` describes the route tree, 
  while `routes_names.dart` and `route_paths.dart` keep names and paths in sync.
* **State-agnostic GoRouter instantiation:**
  GoRouter is constructed either via Riverpod provider or Cubit-based factory, always with dependency injection for reactive auth state.
* **Auth state driven** 
  Auth state is provided via AuthCubit or `authStateStreamProvider` (for Riverpod)). 
  GoRouter instance watches the **auth state** and re-evaluates routes on changes
* **Centralized redirects:**
  The `RoutesRedirectionService` handles all global redirects in one place
* **Custom observers:**
  Navigation observers (like `OverlaysCleanerWithinNavigation`) handle side-effects such as dismissing overlays on navigation change.
* **Navigation extensions:**
  Extensions on `BuildContext` and result types provide a concise, ergonomic API for navigation, error flows, and result handling.
* **Testable, replaceable:**
  Each piece (routes, redirects, observers, transitions) is isolated and can be replaced or unit-tested independently.

### Typical Navigation Flow

1. **App bootstraps** and resolves auth state (or other guards).
2. **GoRouter** is created with centralized route tree, observers, and redirect logic.
3. **On navigation**, observers trigger overlay cleanup and logging.
4. **If redirect needed**, `RoutesRedirectionService` maps the current app/auth state to the desired route.
5. **All navigation logic** can be unit-tested or replaced for e2e, QA, or new business rules.



----------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔁 Current Redirect Logic: Flow & Rules

All redirect logic is centralized in `RoutesRedirectionService.from(...)` — ensuring users always land where they belong, 
based on authentication and verification state. No duplicate logic in UI or widgets!

### Core Redirect Rules

* **Loading**: If auth state is loading/unknown, always redirect to `/splash` (unless already there).
* **Auth Error**: On authentication error, redirect to `/signin`.
* **Unauthenticated**: If not signed in, only allow public routes (`/signin`, `/signup`, `/resetPassword`). 
  All other routes redirect to `/signin`.
* **Email Not Verified**: If signed in but email not verified, redirect to `/verifyEmail` (unless already there).
* **Authenticated & Verified**: If user is fully authenticated and verified and lands on splash, public, or verify pages, redirect to `/home`.
* **Redundant Redirect Prevention**: If already on `/home` and state is valid — no redirect (prevents loops).
* **Default**: If none of the above, stay on the current page.

### Redirect Flow Table

| Condition                | Redirects to                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Loading/Unknown          | `/splash`                            |
| Auth Error               | `/signin`                            |
| Unauthenticated          | `/signin` (if not public)            |
| Email not verified       | `/verifyEmail`                       |
| Authenticated & Verified | `/home` (if on splash/verify/public) |
| On `/home` + valid state | No redirect                          |
| Anything else            | No redirect                          |

---

> **All private routes are protected by default. Redirects are triggered automatically on state change.**
> To add custom guards or flows, simply extend `RoutesRedirectionService.from(...)`.




----------------------------------------------------------------

## 📝 Usage

### Page Navigation (with extensions)

```dart
// Simple navigation via context extensions
context.goToHome();
context.goToProfile(userId: '123');

// Result-based navigation (using ResultNavigationX)
final result = await someAsyncAction();
result.navigateOrShowError(context, onSuccess: (data) => context.goToProfile());

// Error navigation (using NavigationXOnFailure)
context.navigateOnFailure(someFailure);

// Named route navigation (GoRouter API)
context.goNamed(RoutesNames.signIn);
context.go(RoutesPaths.home);
```

### Reactive Navigation (redirects/auth flows)

* All redirects (e.g., auth, verify email, splash, error) are handled **automatically** by `RoutesRedirectionService`.
* No need to manually check auth state or duplicate logic in UI.
* To add a new redirect, extend `RoutesRedirectionService.from()` with your custom logic.

### Overlay-cleaning on navigation

* Overlays, dialogs, toasts are **automatically dismissed** when navigating via context or observers.
* No manual overlay closing required!

> **All navigation is declarative, testable, and DX-first — no imperative Navigator calls in your UI.**



----------------------------------------------------------------

## ❓ FAQ

> **How do I add a new route?**

* Add it to `app_routes.dart` (GoRoute), and define its path/name in `routes_names.dart` / `route_paths.dart`.
* Implement the page widget in `/pages`.

---

> **How do I add a new redirect/guard?**

* Edit `RoutesRedirectionService.from()` and declare your custom guard logic (e.g., role-based, onboarding, etc).
* All auth/email/splash/404 redirects are already handled — just extend the logic.

---

> **How do I customize transitions?**

* Override transition fields in your GoRoute definition in `app_routes.dart` (e.g., pageBuilder, transitionBuilder).

---

> **How do I handle unknown/404 routes?**

* The fallback route is declared in `app_routes.dart` via `errorBuilder: (ctx, state) => PageNotFound(...)`.

---

> **How do I unit-test navigation or redirects?**

* All logic is testable — call `RoutesRedirectionService.from()` in your test with mock states.
* GoRouter and all extension methods are isolated and composable.

---

> **How do I perform navigation from async results/errors?**

* Use `ResultNavigationX` and `NavigationXOnFailure` extensions for declarative flows (see Usage section).



----------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Best Practices

* **Keep all route declarations in `/routes`:** Never hardcode route names or paths in your UI/widgets. 
  Always use named routes via constants (`RoutesNames`, `RoutesPaths`)
* **All navigation/redirect logic lives outside UI** No inline navigation in widgets.
  All global app redirect logic flow (auth, onboarding, splash) must go via `RoutesRedirectionService` only.
* **Use navigation extensions:** Always prefer `context.goToXxx()`, `ResultNavigationX`, 
  and failure-based navigation over raw Navigator/GoRouter calls.
* **Use OverlaysCleanerWithinNavigation** for dismissing overlays automatically, 
  use it for overlay/dialog cleanup instead of manual UI code.
* **Error Handling & Chaining navigation**
  Use `FailureNavigationX` to handle redirects on domain failures (e.g. 401 → sign out and go to `/signin`)
  Use `ResultNavigationExt` to trigger navigation after successful results in a functional style
* **Consistent naming:** Stick to the established pattern for routes, names, and extension methods.



---

## ⚠️ Avoid Pitfalls

* **No imperative navigation in UI:** Don’t use `Navigator.push` or `GoRouter.of(context)` directly in widgets.
* **No duplicated redirect logic:** Never check auth state for redirects in the UI — always centralize in redirection service.
* **No hardcoded paths:** Route paths and names must always be sourced from constants.
* **No mixing logic:** Don’t mix navigation code with business or state logic — keep flows declarative and isolated.
* **No manual overlay closing:** Never close overlays/dialogs manually after navigation; use observers.



----------------------------------------------------------------

## ✅ Final Notes

* Universal: Works with both Riverpod and Cubit/BLoC (only state injection layer differs)
* Fully declarative: Navigation, redirects, and side effects are centralized, testable, and extendable
* UI-agnostic: All navigation code is outside the widget layer
* Overlay-safe: All overlays/toasts/dialogs are auto-dismissed on navigation
* Predictable: Navigation flow, redirects, errors, and page not found are always handled
